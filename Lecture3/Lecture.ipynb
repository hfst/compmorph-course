    "\n",
    "Create an xfst script that implements a spell checker for your Finnish compound-word vocabulary.\n",
    "Do it step by step as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "a. First add one substitution rule that permits the substitution of the letter 'k' by the letter 'j' with some weight.\n",
    "Again, the weight does not have to be a logprob; some positive number is sufficient.\n",
    "Do not yet project your vocabulary transducer (using the .l operator), nor invert the final transducer (using the .i operator).\n",
    "\n",
    "b. Again, start the xfst shell and run `set print-weight ON`, so that the weights are displayed.\n",
    "(Two xfst shells cannot be run at the same time - exit any running shells with command \"exit\" first.)\n",
    "Generate all surface forms for the lexical string ‚Äúkissa+Nom+kO‚Äù.\n",
    "The command ‚Äúdown kissa+Nom+kO‚Äù should produce four forms: ‚Äúkissako‚Äù, ‚Äújissako‚Äù, ‚Äúkissajo‚Äù, and ‚Äújissajo‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "c. Next, project the vocabulary transducer to its lower level and invert the final transducer.\n",
    "Now, you should have a ‚Äúproper‚Äù spell checker; for instance, when you type ‚Äúdown jissajo‚Äù the output should be the corrected form: ‚Äúkissako‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "d. Add more noise-introducing alternations with weights:\n",
    "you should have at least 5 different cases of each of the following types: substitutions, insertions, deletions and transpositions.\n",
    "\n",
    "e. Start the xfst shell and run `set print-weight ON`, and output some random upper (noisy) and lower (corrected) forms sorted by weight.\n",
    "\n",
    "f. Figure out what the correct spellings are for some of the weirdest noisy random words you produced in e).\n",
    "Depending on your model, you would type something like: down √§hm√∂p√§iialo (a misspelled variant of the funny word ‚Äús√§hk√∂p√§√§kissako‚Äù).\n",
